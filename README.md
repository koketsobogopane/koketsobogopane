<h1>👋Hi there!</h1> 

<h2>:hand:About Me</h2>

☄️I am Koketso Bogopane, I am currently a Software development student at CodeSpace Academy 

🚀I am excited to learn and grow my skills in web development and beyond. I am enthusiastic 
about learning new technolies and I would also like to contribute to Open Source Projects.
At CodeSpace I will be learning technologies such as  node, vue, nuxt.js, GraphQL, Git and Netlify 
but this will not limit me from doing my own exploring into other new technologies.

🦾Besides from this new journey I am now immersed in I also like to push myself and develop new skills like 
building pcs, building fpvs, digital illustration.

🗺️When I am having fun I am either walking my dog or skething anything. I would like to adopt new hobbies like 
reading more personal development books and financial literacy. I would also like to explore the world if I was given
the chance to learn how technologies are affecting the world and how the world is dealing with this.
